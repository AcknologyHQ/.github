### Commit Message Conventions

you can use [conventionalcommits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) or use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) to write commit messages.

> **gitmoji** is preferred because it is easier to read and write.

Your commit messages should follow these conventions:

- be short and concise
- be written in a way that makes sense for the project
- be written in a way that is easy to read
- be written in a way that is easy to understand
- be written in a way that is easy to review

A good commit message is one that:

- has [scope] for changes in specific parts of the project
- has [subject] for the commit message

**Types**

for basic types of commits

type | conventional | gitmoji | description
