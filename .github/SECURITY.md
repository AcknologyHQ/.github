**Bug Bounty**

At this moment, Acknology does not have any formal system in place for rewarding individuals, researchers, and security professionals who identify and report potential security vulnerabilities or "bugs" in our products, services, and open source projects. 

Currently, we do not have a formal mechanism for acknowledging or compensating these individuals for their efforts in this regard. However, we greatly value the contributions of these individuals and their efforts to help ensure the security and integrity of our offerings. We appreciate their time and dedication to helping us improve the security of our products, services, and open source projects. 

While we may not have a formal bug bounty program at this time, we encourage these individuals to continue to report any potential vulnerabilities they may discover and will work to address them as promptly as possible.
