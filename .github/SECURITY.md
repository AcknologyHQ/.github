## Security Disclosure

This document provides guidelines on disclosure of vulnerabilities in the projects, and components that the [Acknology](https://github.com/AcknologyHQ) manages and how to report them. Security is important to us.

## Vulnerabilities

**What is a vulnerability?**

Given the [Acknology](https://github.com/AcknologyHQ)'s many components and projects, a vulnerability could occur in one or multiple places or particularly in specific part of our projects and components.

One of the most critical parts of any system is input handling. If malicious input can trigger side effects or incorrect behavior, this is a bug, and likely a vulnerability.

Any method that circumvents the normal auth process is a vulnerability and should be reported.

**Reporting vulnerabilities**

Please email reports about any security related issues you find to `security@acknology.co`. Your email will be acknowledged, and you'll receive a more detailed response to your email indicating the next steps we take in handling your report.

* A description of the technical details of the vulnerabilities. It is very important to let us know how we can reproduce your findings.
